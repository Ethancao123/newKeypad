Do you want a keypad for WASD or arrow keys? Are you looking for something you can use for access to keyboard shortcuts in professional applications like Photoshop? Maybe you just want a keypad with osu! that has more keys so you have easy access to a smoke key and volume adjustment. This keypad can do it all (albeit with a little less RGB flair than the 4K Keypad.)

// Colors
Etsy only allows a max of 2 variations for listings, so I couldn't add case color as an option. You can choose between black, white, and clear. Please leave a comment at checkout telling me what color you want, otherwise you will be given clear.

// Switch changing
The switches on all keypads (except the LED model) can now be opened without being removed, allowing you to swap out the stems and springs with other switches.

// Side Button Functionality
The side button not only works as an escape key like it does on the basic model, but also allows you to change some settings of the keypad. Depending on how long you hold the button, you can use this functionality. The LEDs will blink between these times.

Less than .5 seconds (press and release): Escape will be pressed and released
.5 - 1.5 seconds: LED mode will change upon release

// New and Improved Remapper
Not only can each key be mapped to up to 3 keys for key combinations, but there are 6 "pages" to switch between by holding the side button and pressing one of the six keys! All of them are stored to non-volatile memory so you can unplug the keypad and it will remember the page you were on along with all of your custom mappings.

// RGB LED
The single RGB LED on key 1 will indicate the current page. It will also cycle through the rainbow when you enter the remapper and change color to the corresponding page you are remapping.

// Reprogrammable
Does something not work the way you'd like it to? Make a feature request on GitHub or dive into the source code and add it yourself!

// 3D Printed Cases
All keypad cases are now 3D printed. This has many benefits, but does result in some visual artifacts. You will be able to see horizontal lines on the sides as well as a zig-zag pattern on the surfaces. These are inherent to 3D printed parts since they are built up one layer at a time.

This was a sacrifice that I was willing to make to improve the keypads further. These models are smaller, allow for the switches to be opened, made with machine precision, and have much nicer cutouts. I've worked hard to not sacrifice any rigidity in the case as well.
