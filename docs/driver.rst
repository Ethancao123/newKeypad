Driver Installation
===================

Windows 8.1 or lower
********************

Before we get started with any remapping or programming, you'll need the driver for the keypad installed. All of my keypads use the same microcontroller, so this procedure will work for any current keypad mode.

`Download Drivers <http://puu.sh/tg52G/f1255ee469.zip>`_

Download and extract the zip to your desktop and open "dpinst-amd64.exe." Follow the wizard and say yes when it asks. That's it!


Windows 10, Mac, and Linux
**************************

No driver installation required. You're done, great job!
