There are two things that should be done before you use your keypad.

Installing the Keycaps

To install the keycaps, put them on top of the switches in the correct orientation and push them down.

O-rings come pre-installed on the keycaps so there is no need to isntall them manually. If you don't like the soft feel and reduced travel of the keys, they can be removed.

Remove Tape Film

The tape on the bottom of the keypad will fix it to your desk so it doesn't move around during play. This tape has a film covering it that must be removed to expose its stickiness.
