This is the no bells and whistles model. 2 Keys and a side button. The side button functions as an escape key and offers no additional functionality.

LED Keypad
************

This is the LED model. It features a white LED on each of the two face keys. The side button functions as escape and is also used to change LED modes and brightness.

Side button functionality
-------------------------
==============  ==============
Hold time       Functionality
==============  ==============
Less than 0.5s  Escape
0.5 - 1.5s      Change LED mode
more than 1.5s  Change brightness (Press Z to lower and X to raise)
==============  ==============

LED modes
-------------------------
==============  ==============
Order           Mode
==============  ==============
1               Reactive - Turns LEDs on when pressed and fades out when released.
2               Push Off - Turns LEDs off when pressed and fades on when released.
3               Breathe - Fades LEDs in and out.
4               On - LEDs stay on.
5               Off - LEDs stay off.
==============  ==============


RGB Keypad

This is the RGB model. It features an RGB LED under each of the two face keys. The side button functions as escape and is also used to change LED modes, brightness, and the colors of the keys on the "custom" LED mode. Since it uses LEDs mounted underneath the switches, Gateron switches are the only option since their semi-transparent housing allows this to work and works perfectly for diffusing the light of the LEDs.

Side button functionality

===================================== ==============
Hold time                             Functionality
===================================== ==============
Less than 0.5s                        Escape
0.5 - 1.5s                            Change LED mode
more than 1.5s                        Change brightness (Press Z to lower and X to raise)
more than 1.5s (on custom LED mode)   Change color per-key
===================================== ==============

LED modes
-------------------------
==============  ==============
Order           Mode
==============  ==============
1               Cycle - Fades through rainbow.
2               Reactive - Turns LEDs on when pressed and fades from red to green to blue to off when released.
3               Push Off - LEDs are normally white and fade from red to green to blue to off when the keys are pressed.
4               Custom - LED color can be set per-key.
5               BPM - LEDs turn white when pressed and change color depending on how much you hit them per second when released.
6               Color Change - Colors cycle in steps per-press per-key.

4K Keypad

This is the 4k model. It's the same as the RGB model but with 4 keys instead of 2. The side button functions as escape and is also used to change LED modes, brightness, and the colors of the keys on the "custom" LED mode. Since it uses LEDs mounted underneath the switches, Gateron switches are the only option since their semi-transparent housing allows this to work and works perfectly for diffusing the light of the LEDs.

more than 1.5s                        Change brightness (Press Z to lower and X to raise)

Macropad
********
.. image:: http://thnikk.moe/img/docs/macropad.png

By popular request, I made a keypad focused less on crazy lights and more on people that want the ability to quickly switch between button mappings. This model features not only the ability to map each key to up to 3 keys, but also six "pages" of mappings that you can change by holding the side button and pressing one of the six keys. It also has a single RGB LED to show the current page.

More than 0.5s                        Change mapping page (1-6 depending on face button pressed)

Future Tone Controller (coming soon)
************************************
.. image:: https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C3ZfWfSUMAAA9Jg.jpg

This is the small controller I made for Hatsune Miku: Project Diva Future Tone for PS4. There is a mode select button on the front of the controller that allows you to switch between DS4 and arcade mode. DS4 mode maps the buttons to the standard DS4 layout and arcade mode maps the keys in a horizontal layout like you'd get on the arcade cabinet. This makes hold notes a lot more natural wihout sacrificing speed since the arrow buttons are all adjacent to their corresponding buttons. When the mode is changed, the LEDs change color to match the corresponding layout.
