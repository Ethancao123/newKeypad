Keypad Models
=============


Basic Keypad
************

.. image:: http://thnikk.moe/img/docs/models/2k.png

A simple 2-key keypad. This was previously the "no bells and whistles" model, but now features a bottom-mounted RGB LED that adds some RGB underglow to the keypad!  The side button functions as escape and is also used to change LED modes and the color of the keys on the "custom" LED mode.

RGB Keypad
************

.. image:: http://thnikk.moe/img/docs/models/2krgb.png

A fancier version of the basic model that features not only the bottom-mounted LED, but also an RGB LED under each key. This makes for much brighter and more prominent lighting effects. The side button functions as escape and is also used to change LED modes, brightness, and the colors of the keys on the "custom" LED mode.

Basic 4K Keypad
***************

A 4-key version of the RGB keypad made for use with Taiko and Mania. Like the 2K basic model, this was previously the "no bells and whistles" model, but now features a bottom-mounted RGB LED that adds some RGB underglow to the keypad!  The side button functions as escape and is also used to change LED modes and the color of the keys on the "custom" LED mode.

Macropad
********

By popular request, I made a keypad focused less on crazy lights and more on people that want the ability to quickly switch between button mappings. This model features not only the ability to map each key to up to 3 keys, but also six "pages" of mappings that you can change by holding the side button and pressing one of the six keys. It also has a single RGB LED to show the current page.

Future Tone Controller
**********************
.. image:: https://img0.etsystatic.com/204/0/10408775/il_fullxfull.1360528126_hpn6.jpg

This is the small controller I made for Hatsune Miku: Project Diva Future Tone for PS4. There is a mode select button on the front of the controller that allows you to switch between DS4 and arcade mode. DS4 mode maps the buttons to the standard DS4 layout and arcade mode maps the keys in a horizontal layout like you'd get on the arcade cabinet. This makes hold notes a lot more natural wihout sacrificing speed since the arrow buttons are all adjacent to their corresponding buttons. When the mode is changed, the LEDs change color to match the corresponding layout.
